# Airbnb Property Price Predictor


Project Proposal: Airbnb Property Price Predictor
 
Unlike established hospitality industry where dedicated management team controls how a property is maintained, Airbnb provides a listing of rental properties posted by individual users without any formal control. Current establishment of hospitality industry relies on the five-star rating system that provides certain measurement of qualities of property that determines pricing point. This allows individual users to gauge the overall quality of a property by looking at the associated star rating, thus users can make an informed decision.

Since there is no formal controls presented in the Airbnb listed properties, it is extremely hard to predict the quality of a rental when an individual user books for a stay. Because of this quality uncertainty, our team decided to find a better predictor for the end-users looking for a rental property. Once determined, this predictor can also possibly help listing individuals how to make their properties more appealing by utilizing such predictor.

After examination of some of listing datasets from the Airbnb.com website, it became apparent that most listing utilized description field of the property to entice users. Some properties focused on the location aspect while others focused on the aesthetic aspect. With this information, we decided to look at the free form text descriptor to find the relationship between the rating and types of words used. By categorizing different descriptors into several groups such as positive adjectives focusing on aesthetic, emphasis on the geolocation, and amenities offered, we are hoping to find which category is a better indicator of the overall rating.

Our team will also use the geo-location information to see if there is any difference in the rental pricing of similar listings when the only difference is the distance to a well-known tourist destination. If there is a positive correlation between how far a property is to a well-known tourist destination, it can help property owners come up with a better strategy to make their property more appealing so they can better compete with properties closer to such destinations
