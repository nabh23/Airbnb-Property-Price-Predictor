# Exploring-Airbnb-Dataset

Exploring Airbnb listings dataset on opendatasoft.com for the following research questions:

Does the presence of an adjective (positive, negative or neutral) in the free-form text in reviews influence the rating of an apartment?
Would season impact the pricing of a rental in cities having same demographics (For e.g, Summer season in Seattle as compared to the summer season in Melbourne)?
Does proximity to a recreational site or any landmark affect the affinity towards a certain listing?
